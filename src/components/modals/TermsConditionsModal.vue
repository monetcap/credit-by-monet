        Website; however, you will need to sign up if you want Credit by Monet to assist you in your efforts to

        <h2>4. Service Agreement</h2>
        <p>In order for Credit by Monet to perform services, you must enter into a separate written agreement
        with Credit by Monet. Each file we create in conjunction with this separate written agreement is called a
        “Member File.” Your Member File will continue to be subject to the agreements otherwise governing
        them, except where so noted in the related agreement. Each Member File will be subject to the
        following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The terms or instructions appearing on a screen when using the service;</li>
        <li>Credit by Monet’s policies and procedures applicable to the Member File and the online service;</li>
        <li>Applicable state and federal laws and regulations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>5. Cancellation Rights</h2>
        <p>You may cancel your contract, without any penalty or obligation, at any time before midnight of the 3rd day which begins after the date
          the contract is signed by client.</p>
        <p>To cancel your contract, mail or deliver a signed and dated copy of this cancellation notice, or any other written notice, to:
          <address>495 Flatbush Ave<br />Brooklyn, New York 11225,<br />United States<br />
          </address></p>

        <h2>6. Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>Client may request a refund if they believe that Credit by Monet did not complete the obligations as defined in our Terms and Conditions, or the Client’s signed agreement.</p>
        <p>Refund of up to 50% of total price may be possible to the Client only if <em>all</em> the below conditions exist:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Client shall have been current on all payments, without any late payments, and Client shall have completed all payments per the agreement.</li>
          <li>Client shall be current on all payments to Credit by Monet, and Client shall have completed all payments per agreement.</li>
          <li>Client shall have followed all Credit by Monet directions based on the credit repair plan (Excessive time spent with clients in any form of communication, or personal meetings will count against the allocated time per plan, and obviously reduce time spent on actual credit repair, therefore client may not get optimal results.)</li>
          <li>On existing credit lines at time of signed agreement, and on any newly obtained credit, whether or not per the Credit by Monet recommendation, Client always made at least the minimum payment due on time per industry suggestion (which was communicated with the Client.)</li>
          <li>Client never exceeded maximum 30% balance-to-available-credit on revolving credit lines (If Client acquired new credit lines on their own, or per Credit by Monet recommendation, and Client has exceeded suggested maximum 30% balance-to-available-credit , and, or late in making minimum on time payments, no refund shall be given.)</li>
          <li>Client was never late and always paid minimum balance due on all existing trade lines, or new credit lines acquired during duration of Credit by Monet agreement.</li>
          <li>Client upon signing Credit by Monet agreement strictly followed at least one of several suggested methods to improve or increase scores as noted in the credit repair plan.</li>
          <li>To receive a 50% refund of total money paid to Credit by Monet, the Client shall request such refund in writing.
          Credit by Monet shall review the request to confirm if Client complied with the terms of our Refund Policy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Credit by Monet shall determine the final refund amount, if any at all, and Credit by Monet decision shall be final.</p>

        <h2>7. Consumer Credit File Rights Under State and Federal Law</h2>
        <p>You have a right to dispute inaccurate information in your credit report by contacting the credit bureau directly. However, neither you nor any ‘credit repair’ company or credit repair organization has the right to have accurate, current, and verifiable information removed from your credit report. The credit bureau must remove accurate, negative information from your report only if it is over 7 years old.
          Bankruptcy information can be reported for 10 years.
          You have a right to obtain a copy of your credit report from a credit bureau. You may be charged a reasonable fee. There is no fee, however, if you have been turned down for credit, employment, insurance, or a rental dwelling because of information in your credit report within the preceding 60 days. The credit bureau must provide someone to help you interpret the information in your credit file.
          You are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report if you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment in the next 60 days, if you are a recipient of public welfare assistance, or if you have reason to believe that there is inaccurate information in your credit report due to f raud.
          You have a right to sue a credit repair organization that violates the Credit Repair Organization Act. This law prohibits deceptive practices by credit repair organizations.
          You have the right to cancel your contract with any credit repair organization for any reason within 3 business days from the date you signed it. Credit bureaus are required to follow reasonable procedures to ensure that the information they report is accurate. However, mistakes may occur.
          You may, on your own, notify a credit bureau in writing that you dispute the accuracy of information in your credit file. The credit bureau must then reinvestigate and modify or remove inaccurate or incomplete information. The credit bureau may not charge any fee for this service. Any pertinent information and copies of all documents you have concerning an error should be given to the credit bureau.
          If the credit bureau’s reinvestigation does not resolve the dispute to your satisfaction, you may send a brief statement to the credit bureau, to be kept in your file, explaining why you think the record is inaccurate. The credit bureau must include a summary of your statement about disput- ed information with any report it issues about you.
          The Federal Trade Commission regulates credit bureaus and credit repair organizations. For more information contact:</p>

        Monet website. These incorporate by reference any notices contained on the Website and constitute
        the entire agreement with respect to access to and use of the Website, and/or your request that Credit
        by Monet contact you about its credit repair services. You agree that the provisions and covenants set
        forth herein are reasonable. In the event that any provision or covenant of the Website Terms shall be
        held invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction for any reason,
        including but not limited to the scope thereof, then such provision will be severed and replaced with a
        new provision that most closely reflects the original intention thereof, and the remaining provisions of
        the Website Terms will remain in full force and effect for the greatest time period and for the broadest
        scope permitted by applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree and request that if any
        court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction considers any provision or covenant of the Website Terms
        to be overly broad based on the circumstances at the time enforcement is requested, that such court or
        arbitrator construe and enforce the provision or covenant to the fullest extent that such court or
        arbitrator deems reasonable.</p>
        <p>THE WEBSITE TERMS SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF

        Arbitration Clause, the obligations in the first four paragraphs of the Website Terms, and Sections 6
        through 8, 11 through 15, and 17 through 20 shall survive termination of the Website Terms.
        Credit by Monet shall not be deemed to have waived any rights or remedies in the Website Terms
        unless such waiver is in writing and signed by Credit by Monet. No delay or omission on the part of
        Credit by Monet in exercising any rights or remedies shall operate as a waiver of such rights or remedies
        or any other rights or remedies. A waiver on any one occasion shall not be construed as a waiver of any
        rights or remedies on future occasions.</p>

        Monet, except as you and Credit by Monet may later agree in writing to modify the Website Terms. The
